## The Opportunity

Provisioning and managing IT infrastructure&mdash;storage, compute, bandwidth, and connectivity&mdash;remains centralized, costly, and vulnerable to chokepoints. Cloud giants dominate access to servers, GPUs, and content delivery, while telecom incumbents gatekeep connectivity and pricing. Systems for inter-carrier settlements, bandwidth resale, and storage verification are inefficient, opaque, and prone to censorship or single points of failure.

## Ideas

- Decentralized compute marketplaces - On-demand markets for GPUs and high-performance compute that let providers sell capacity directly to users
- Open connectivity infrastructure - Mesh networks, shared spectrum, and satellite links that reduce reliance on incumbent telecom operators
- Decentralized VPNs and bandwidth sharing - Peer-to-peer networks where participants provide and consume bandwidth without centralized gateways
- Token-incentivized data services - Streaming, video, sensor, and mapping services funded and operated through cryptoeconomic incentives rather than platform monopolies
- Inter-carrier settlement and provisioning - Shared ledgers for clearing, settlement, and coordination between networks and infrastructure providers
- Real-time resource pricing - Pay-per-use and priority-access mechanisms for scarce resources like bandwidth, compute, or storage under contention

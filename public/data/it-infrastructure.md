# IT Infrastructure

## The Opportunity
Cloud computing is dominated by a few giants. Decentralized infrastructure offers censorship resistance, lower costs, and better uptime through redundancy.

## Ideas

### Decentralized Storage
Rent out unused hard drive space to store encrypted files for others (like Airbnb for data).

### Decentralized Compute
Rent out idle GPU/CPU cycles for rendering or AI model training.

### Decentralized RPC
Networks of nodes serving blockchain data requests to ensure no single point of failure for dApps.

## Projects

### Filecoin
- Status: active
- URL: https://filecoin.io

### Akash Network
- Status: active
- URL: https://akash.network
Open network for cloud computing.

## Bounties

### Build a Filecoin Storage Bridge
- Amount: 2000 USDC

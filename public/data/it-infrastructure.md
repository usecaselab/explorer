## The Opportunity

Provisioning and managing IT infrastructure&mdash;storage, compute, bandwidth, and connectivity&mdash;remains centralized, costly, and vulnerable to chokepoints. Cloud giants dominate access to servers, GPUs, and content delivery, while telecom incumbents gatekeep connectivity and pricing. Systems for inter-carrier settlements, bandwidth resale, and storage verification are inefficient, opaque, and prone to censorship or single points of failure.

## Ideas

- GPU and compute marketplaces for AI and high-performance workloads
- Open telecom and connectivity infrastructure (mesh, satellite, spectrum sharing, 5G, e-sim)
- Decentralized VPNs, mixnets and bandwidth-sharing markets
- Streaming, video, sensor and mapping services powered by token incentives
- Intercarrier settlements and cross-network provisioning
- General pattern of real time payment for priority access to contested resources.

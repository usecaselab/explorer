# Transport & Logistics

## The Opportunity
Logistics is complex, involving many parties (shippers, carriers, customs) who use different systems. Paperwork (like Bills of Lading) causes delays. Visibility into shipment status is often poor.

## Ideas

### Electronic Bill of Lading (eBL)
Tokenizing the legal title document for cargo to speed up transfer of ownership and release of goods.

### Shared Logistics State
A unified ledger for all parties to track the location and status of a shipment in real-time.

### Vehicle Identity
Passports for trucks or ships that record maintenance history, insurance, and ownership to increase resale value and safety.

### Automated Freight Settlement
Smart contracts that release payment to carriers immediately upon proof of delivery.

## The Opportunity

The movement of people and goods today depends on a patchwork of identifiers, registries and event data covering fleets, parts, service providers and agencies. Because these records are fragmented, coordination is slower, costs are higher, and gaps open up in safety, compliance and lifecycle management. As vehicles electrify, become software-defined and participate in new mobility ecosystems (shared fleets, autonomous operations), regulators increasingly require verifiable digital records—but the existing siloed systems are poorly suited to deliver them.

With the rise of connected and autonomous vehicles, the requirement for audit trails (for safety, liability, and compliance) further magnifies the need for a unified digital trust layer.

## Ideas

- Real-time traceability for vehicle parts - For example, the OriginTrail solution for rail-fleet traceability via its Decentralized Knowledge Graph. ([origintrail.io](http://origintrail.io))
- Identity solutions for interoperable transit credentials - Self-sovereign identity (SSI) for transit across operators and countries. (e.g., research on blockchain-enabled identity management in public transportation) ([TCI Transportation](https://tcitransportation.com/blog/blockchain-technology-in-transportation-what-you-need-to-know/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))
- Decentralized car-sharing and mobility marketplaces - Peer-to-peer mobility services replacing centralized ride-hailing fleets. (see ARTICONF prototype) ([TCI Transportation](https://tcitransportation.com/blog/blockchain-technology-in-transportation-what-you-need-to-know/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))
- Open sensor and telematics data networks for urban mobility and traffic optimization - Shared data layers unlocking new business models. ([TCI Transportation](https://tcitransportation.com/blog/blockchain-technology-in-transportation-what-you-need-to-know/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))
- Electric vehicle (EV) charging coordination and energy trading across heterogeneous participants - Clearinghouses for roaming, settlement and energy credits. (see research on EV charging market hubs) ([emerald.com](http://emerald.com))
- Digital vehicle passports and lifecycle provenance - End-to-end records of manufacture, service, ownership, recycling (see digital product passports (DPP) research). ([Logistics Viewpoints](https://logisticsviewpoints.com/2024/09/04/how-blockchain-technology-powers-the-foundation-of-digital-product-passports/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))
- Proof of location and automated payments - e.g. automatic demurrage payments in shipping or logistics flows.

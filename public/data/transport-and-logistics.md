## The Opportunity

The movement of people and goods today depends on a patchwork of identifiers, registries and event data covering fleets, parts, service providers and agencies. Because these records are fragmented, coordination is slower, costs are higher, and gaps open up in safety, compliance and lifecycle management. As vehicles electrify, become software-defined, and participate in new mobility ecosystems (e.g., shared fleets, autonomous operations), regulators increasingly require verifiable digital records&mdash;but the existing siloed systems are poorly suited to deliver them.

With the rise of connected and autonomous vehicles, the requirement for audit trails (for safety, liability, and compliance) further magnifies the need for a unified digital trust layer.

## Ideas

- Transit credentials - Self-sovereign identities for drivers, vehicles, and riders that work across operators, cities, and borders
- Mobility marketplaces - Peer-to-peer car sharing and mobility services coordinated by protocols
- Urban mobility data networks - Shared sensor and telematics data layers that support traffic optimization, and planning
- EV charging coordination - Interoperable systems for energy credit settlement across charging networks and grid participants
- Parts traceability and provenance - Real-time tracking of vehicle components across manufacture, installation, servicing, and recall to improve safety and compliance
- Digital vehicle passports - End-to-end, tamper-evident records covering manufacturing, ownership, maintenance, accidents, and recycling
- Automated logistics payments - Verifiable location and event proofs that trigger payments or contract execution in transport and supply chains

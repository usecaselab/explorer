## The Opportunity

Travel is held back by fragmented identity and compliance checks, siloed reservation and ticketing systems, slow interline settlement, and opaque baggage and cargo handoffs. Disruptions cascade because airlines, airports, and service providers lack a shared operational state, while insurance claims, visas, and cross-border payments rely on manual and duplicative verification. Loyalty programs remain closed, tourism operators run on incompatible systems, and traveler trust doesn’t port across platforms. The result is friction, fraud, long queues, and costly coordination failures across the entire travel stack.

## Ideas

- Interoperable reservations - Shared primitives for searching, holding, booking, changing, canceling, and refunding inventory across travel suppliers
- Portable traveler identity - Verifiable credentials for identity, eligibility, reviews, and safety checks that can be reused across platforms with minimal data sharing
- Tokenized loyalty - Transferable loyalty points and benefits that can be earned and redeemed across airlines, hotels, and travel marketplaces
- Parametric travel insurance - Automatic insurance payouts triggered by verifiable events such as delays, cancellations, or lost baggage
- Tokenized travel inventory - Onchain representations of tickets and reservations that enable resale, bundling, and dynamic packaging

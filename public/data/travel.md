# Travel

## The Opportunity
Travel is held back by fragmented identity and compliance checks, siloed reservation and ticketing systems, slow interline settlement, and opaque baggage and cargo handoffs. Disruptions cascade because airlines, airports, and service providers lack a shared operational state, while insurance claims, visas, and cross-border payments rely on manual and duplicative verification. Loyalty programs remain closed, tourism operators run on incompatible systems, and traveler trust doesn’t port across platforms. The result is friction, fraud, long queues, and costly coordination failures across the entire travel stack.

## Ideas

### Interoperable reservations
Standard primitives for inventory, hold, book, change, cancel and refund across suppliers.

### Portable identity
Verifiable traveler/host credentials, age/KYC checks, reviews and safety attestations that can be shared with minimal data exposure.

### Tokenized loyalty
Cross-brand accrual/redemption and perks that work across OTAs, airlines and hotels.

### Parametric travel insurance
Oracle-triggered automatic payouts for delays, cancellations or lost baggage.

### Inventory tokenization
Fractional or transferable entitlements (e.g., airline tickets, hotel rooms) unlocking resale, bundling or dynamic packaging.

## The Opportunity

Travel is held back by fragmented identity and compliance checks, siloed reservation and ticketing systems, slow interline settlement, and opaque baggage and cargo handoffs. Disruptions cascade because airlines, airports, and service providers lack a shared operational state, while insurance claims, visas, and cross-border payments rely on manual and duplicative verification. Loyalty programs remain closed, tourism operators run on incompatible systems, and traveler trust doesn’t port across platforms. The result is friction, fraud, long queues, and costly coordination failures across the entire travel stack.

## Ideas

- Interoperable reservations - Standard primitives for inventory, hold, book, change, cancel and refund across suppliers (see [International Air Transport Association (IATA) NDC standard](https://www.iata.org/en/programs/airline-distribution/retailing/ndc/))
- Portable identity & reputation - Verifiable traveler/host credentials, age/KYC checks, reviews and safety attestations that can be shared with minimal data exposure (see [International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) Digital Travel Credentials](https://www.icao.int/Security/FAL/TRIP/Documents/High%20Level%20Guidance%20explaining%20ICAO%20DTC.pdf))
- Tokenized loyalty - Cross-brand accrual/redemption and perks that work across OTAs, airlines and hotels
- Parametric travel insurance - Oracle-triggered automatic payouts for delays, cancellations or lost baggage
- Inventory tokenization - Fractional or transferable entitlements (e.g., airline tickets, hotel rooms) unlocking resale, bundling or dynamic packaging
- Atomic booking - Booking an entire itinerary (flights, hotel, event) in a single transaction to eliminate partial booking risk and minimize “held” inventory time

## The Opportunity

Retail and e-commerce workflows require stitching together product sourcing, inventory management, payments, logistics and after-sales service across many disconnected systems. Merchants and customers face risks from fraud, counterfeit goods, unreliable reviews, and disputes over refunds. The result is high operational overhead, multiple intermediaries, and limited portability of data and value across stores and marketplaces for users.

## Ideas

- Onchain merchant payments - Lower fees, instant settlement and programmable refunds reduce payment-rail friction
- Verifiable reviews & receipts - Onchain attestations improve authenticity, support returns and reduce dispute risk
- Physical goods marketplaces - Tokenized listings and escrowed settlement bring transparency to resale and secondary markets
- Commerce identity - Reusable KYC and proof credentials reduce onboarding friction and fraud across merchants and marketplaces
- Agent-driven commerce - Autonomous agents executing shopping tasks, rebates or optimized purchasing flows with onchain negotiation, payments, and reputation
- Integrated commerce stack - Potential for integrating supply-chain provenance, dynamic pricing and loyalty token-flows in one unified stack

# Retail & Ecommerce

## The Opportunity
E-commerce is dominated by giant platforms that charge high fees and own the customer relationship. Counterfeit goods dilute brand value. Loyalty points are often stuck in siloed programs.

## Ideas

### Interoperable Loyalty Programs
Tokens that can be earned at one retailer and spent at another, or exchanged on open markets.

### Digital Twins for Luxury Goods
NFTs paired with physical items (phygital) to prove authenticity and ownership history.

### Decentralized Marketplaces
Peer-to-peer commerce protocols where buyers and sellers transact directly with lower fees and shared governance.

### Community Commerce
Brands allowing their community to co-create products and share in the revenue of the items they helped design.

### Problem

Retail and eCommerce workflows require stitching together product sourcing, inventory management, payments, logistics and after-sales service across many disconnected systems. Merchants and customers face risks from fraud, counterfeit goods, unreliable reviews and disputes over refunds. The result is high operational overhead, multiple intermediaries and limited portability of data and value across stores and marketplaces for users.

---

### Opportunities

- **Onchain merchant payments:** Lower fees, instant settlement and programmable refunds reduce payment-rail friction.
- **Tokenized loyalty:** Portable rewards with benefits and access gated by tokens or NFTs enable new loyalty architectures.
- **Verifiable reviews & receipts:** Onchain attestations improve authenticity, support returns and reduce dispute risk.
- **Physical goods marketplaces:** Tokenized listings and escrowed settlement bring transparency to resale and secondary markets.
- **Commerce identity:** Reusable KYC and proof credentials reduce onboarding friction and fraud across merchants and marketplaces.
- **Agent-driven commerce:** Autonomous agents or bots executing shopping tasks, rebates or optimized purchasing flows with onchain coordination.
- **Autonomous auctions:** Where goods can be priced and sold without an intermediary.
- **Full Commerce Stack:** Potential for integrating supply-chain provenance, dynamic pricing and loyalty token-flows in one unified commerce stack.

### Emerging Trends

- AI-first merchandising and dynamic-pricing models (used by Shopify and Amazon) increase demand for programmable commerce logic.
- Omnichannel workflows like buy-online-pickup-in-store and optimized last-mile (via DoorDash, Instacart) raise expectations for seamless experience and shared data.
- Embedded checkout and one-click wallets (Shop Pay, Apple Pay) shift consumer expectation toward frictionless transactions.
- Enterprise loyalty programs are revamping around richer data sharing and member value (airlines, Starbucks).

### Leverage Points

- Agentic micropayment/stablecoin TradFi platforms (e.g. Tempo, OpenAI × Stripe Agent Commerce Protocol, Visa Intelligent Commerce Protocol, Coinbase x402) are redefining how consumers engage with merchants. With x402 there are new primitives for converting fiat to stablecoins.
- Major fintechs and retailers are exploring stablecoin rails for payments (e.g., Stripe, Shopify, Amazon, Walmart) signaling readiness for new rails.
- Pilot a merchant-token loyalty ecosystem where tokenized rewards flow across brands and redeem in open exchange.
- Countries such as Japan already have strong points/rewards commerce which are currently siloed (many different cards/apps for different brand points) and also a strong “fan”/oshikatsu (”supporting activities”) culture.
- Recently approved JYPC Stablecoin.

### Enablers / Blockers

- **Payment standards:** Onchain commerce requires interoperable, low-friction payment rails and token conversion flow.
- **Identity & reputation:** Reused credentials and attestation reduce fraud and onboarding friction for merchants and customers.
- **Institutional inertia:** Large retail systems, payment processors and SaaS platforms resist changing established rails and workflows.

### Why It Matters for Ethereum

This use case shows how Ethereum can serve as the infrastructure for commerce flows often locked behind multiple intermediaries and fragmented systems. Onchain payments, tokenized loyalty and verifiable receipts reduce cost, increase trust and unlock portability of value. By aligning merchant rails, identity, tokens and settlement on a shared platform, Ethereum strengthens its network effect and transitions retail commerce from siloed workflows to a connected, programmable ecosystem.

*This use case is especially promising because the retail sector is large, well-understood and contains many players ready for innovation rather than speculation. Users are also experiencing bloat in loyalty programs and payment options.*

# Data

## The Opportunity
Data is currently siloed in large corporations or sold without user consent. Individuals generate valuable data but capture none of the value, while developers struggle to access quality datasets for AI and analytics.

## Ideas

### Personal Data Unions
Organizations that aggregate user data with consent and negotiate bulk sales to advertisers or researchers, distributing profits back to users.

### Compute-to-Data
Allow algorithms to run on data where it resides (on-premise or on-device) without the raw data ever leaving its secure environment.

### AI Model Marketplace
Decentralized exchanges where data scientists can sell trained models or datasets with proven provenance and quality.

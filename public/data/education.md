# Education

## The Opportunity
Credentialing is slow, prone to fraud, and disconnected from skills. Learning resources are abundant but verification of knowledge remains centralized and expensive.

## Ideas

### On-chain Credentials (SBTs)
Non-transferable tokens representing completed courses, degrees, or skills that are instantly verifiable by employers.

### Learn-to-Earn
Protocols that incentivize learning by distributing tokens to students who complete proofs of knowledge.

### Decentralized Peer Review
Academic publishing systems where peer review and citation reputation are tracked transparently on-chain.

# Advocacy & Rights

## The Opportunity
Human rights violations often go undocumented or are suppressed by authoritarian regimes. Activists risk their lives to share truth. Censorship prevents the free flow of information, and digital surveillance threatens the safety of vulnerable populations.

## Ideas

### Uncensorable Archives
Permanent, immutable storage for evidence of war crimes or human rights abuses that cannot be deleted or altered by governments.

### Anonymous Whistleblowing
Platforms that allow individuals to report corruption or abuse without revealing their identity or IP address, leveraging mixnets and zero-knowledge proofs.

### Proof of Presence
Tools for protesters to verify their attendance at events or the location of incidents without exposing their full identity.

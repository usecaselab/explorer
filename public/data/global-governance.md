## Problem

Global and sub-national governance suffers from fragmented frameworks, inconsistent enforcement, and lack of trust. When multiple parties (nations, cities, regions) must cooperate on resource-shared issues—climate, migration, infrastructure, AI regulation—they face high coordination costs, opaque commitments, and weak verification. At the city or regional level the challenge is similar: neighboring jurisdictions adopt divergent rules, data is siloed, and collaboration lacks transparency or enforceability across boundaries.

## Opportunities

Establishing interoperable, verifiable agreements and coordination mechanisms across jurisdictions—nations, cities, regions— to solve transnational problems through shared rules and frameworks.

- **Smart treaties:** Codified obligations for climate agreements, arms-control, trade pacts that can map to verifiable events and smart-contract logic.
- **Common-pool resource management:** Verifiable tracking of emissions, fishing quotas, biodiversity credits or water-basin usage across borders.
- **Cross-boundary regulatory harmonization:** Interoperable compliance frameworks for aviation, shipping, carbon markets, or city-region transit systems.
- **International aid accountability:** Transparent tracking of aid funds across countries or cities, with audit-logs and verifiable milestones.
- **Governance of multilateral bodies:** On-chain registries and decision-logs for institutions like the United Nations, World Trade Organization (WTO) or regional bodies.
- **Space governance & digital commons:** Registries for orbital slots, debris, regional airspace or global digital resources.
- **City/regional protocol networks:** Shared modular policy frameworks adopted by cities and regions (e.g., climate accords, mobility pacts) that reference common data protocols.

## Leverage Points

- Pilot a **city-region network agreement** (e.g for shared transit or climate mitigation) using a ledger for commitments, data-sharing and audit-logs. C40 cities, Bloomberg City IdeasXChange
- Convene a **multilateral governance lab** (state actors, cities, NGOs, tech providers) to design modular policy frameworks and data-protocol standards for treaty-networks.
- Common pool resource management

## Enablers / Blockers

- **Legal recognition & sovereignty constraints:** International or multi-jurisdictional agreements must interface with national/legal frameworks; sovereignty limits fully automated enforcement. Without legal backing and cross-jurisdiction recognition, ledger-based treaty logic may lack enforceability.
- **Interoperability & Standards:** Diverse jurisdictions, data models, languages and regulatory regimes require common protocols, data schemas and oracles. Each collaboration remains bespoke and the network effect is weak if interoperability isn’t addressed (related to cross-jurisdictional recognition). Need shared registries, protocol modules and verification services that are sovereign but also able to plug into each other when needed.
- **Institutional inertia & multi-stakeholder complexity:** Engaging states, cities, NGOs and private actors in shared protocol adoption is complex and slow. Coordination friction and lack of precedent slow deployment of large-scale treaty-networks.

## Why It Matters for Ethereum

Ethereum can support new forms of governance beyond single-state frameworks: city-networks, regional pacts or international treaties. As collaboration across borders becomes more critical—whether for climate, digital infrastructure or resource management—Ethereum offers a credible substrate for transparent, programmable coordination across multiple stakeholders and jurisdictions.

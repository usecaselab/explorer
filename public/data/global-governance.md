## The Opportunity

Global and sub-national governance suffers from fragmented frameworks, inconsistent enforcement, and lack of trust. When multiple parties (e.g., nations, cities, regions) must cooperate on resource-shared issues&mdash;climate, migration, infrastructure, AI regulation&mdash;they face high coordination costs, opaque commitments, and weak verification. At the city or regional level the challenge is similar: neighboring jurisdictions adopt divergent rules, data is siloed, and collaboration lacks transparency or enforceability across boundaries.

## Ideas

- Smart treaties - Codified obligations for climate agreements, arms-control, trade pacts that can map to verifiable events and smart-contract logic
- Common-pool resource management - Verifiable tracking of emissions, fishing quotas, biodiversity credits or water-basin usage across borders
- Cross-boundary regulatory harmonization - Interoperable compliance frameworks for aviation, shipping, carbon markets, or city-region transit systems
- International aid accountability - Transparent tracking of aid funds across countries or cities, with audit-logs and verifiable milestones
- Governance of multilateral bodies - Onchain registries and decision-logs for institutions like the United Nations, World Trade Organization (WTO) or regional bodies
- Space governance & digital commons - Registries for orbital slots, debris, regional airspace or global digital resources
- City/regional protocol networks - Shared modular policy frameworks adopted by cities and regions (e.g., climate accords, mobility pacts) that reference common data protocols

# Global Governance

## The Opportunity
Global challenges like climate change, ocean management, and space exploration require coordination beyond nation-states. Current international treaties are hard to enforce, and management of the "global commons" suffers from the tragedy of the commons.

## Ideas

### Smart Treaties
International agreements codified as smart contracts that automatically release funding or impose penalties based on verifiable data (e.g., emission levels).

### Ocean DAOs
Decentralized organizations dedicated to cleaning and protecting specific ocean zones, funded by donors and governed by stakeholders.

### Space Debris Registry
A transparent, global ledger of objects in orbit to prevent collisions and manage liability.

### Global Identity Standards
Self-sovereign identity systems that work across borders, aiding refugees and stateless individuals.

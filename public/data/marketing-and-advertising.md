## The Opportunity

Digital advertising is dominated by centralized platforms that control audience data, take large cuts of ad spend, and operate with limited transparency. Fraud, fake impressions, and opaque attribution undermine trust. Creators and consumers capture little of the value they generate, while advertisers face rising costs and shrinking margins.

## Ideas

- Decentralized ad networks - transparent impression tracking, voluntary disclosure with ZK proofs.
- Onchain influencer marketing - verifiable reach and engagement for payouts.
- Programmable ad spend - direct funding of dapps or public goods via ad revenue.
- Tokenized loyalty and rewards - integrating ad campaigns with consumer incentives.

## The Opportunity

Digital advertising is dominated by centralized platforms that control audience data, take large cuts of ad spend, and operate with limited transparency. Fraud, fake impressions, and opaque attribution undermine trust. Creators and consumers capture little of the value they generate, while advertisers face rising costs and shrinking margins.

## Ideas

- Ad networks - Transparent impression tracking, voluntary disclosure with ZK proofs
- Influencer marketing - Verifiable reach and engagement for payouts
- Programmable ad spend - Direct funding of dapps or public goods via ad revenue
- Tokenized loyalty and rewards - Integrating ad campaigns with consumer incentives

## Examples

- [The Miracle](https://www.themiracle.io/) - Target & activate crypto users
- [EarnOS](https://earnos.com/) - Privacy-preserving ad targeting where users prove actions (e.g., app usage, trading volume, fitness activity) to brands for rewards without exposing personal data
- [Brave](https://brave.com/) - Pays users for their attention to advertisements and users can pay publishers to support them
- [Blackbird](https://www.blackbird.xyz/) - Dining rewards

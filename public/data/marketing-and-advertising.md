# Marketing & Advertising

## The Opportunity
Ad tech is plagued by fraud and middlemen taking 50%+ of spend. Users are tracked without consent. Web3 offers direct attribution and user ownership.

## Ideas

### Brave/BAT Model
Users get paid to view ads; advertisers pay users directly, removing the middleman.

### On-Chain Attribution
Verifying marketing ROI by tracking conversion events (wallet transactions) directly on-chain without cookies.

### Token-Gated Communities
Brands creating exclusive content or merchandise access for holders of their NFTs.

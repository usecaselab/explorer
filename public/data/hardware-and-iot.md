# Hardware & IoT

## The Opportunity
IoT devices are insecure and lack a unified payment layer. Machine-to-machine economy requires trustless coordination and micropayments.

## Ideas

### Machine Identity
Giving every IoT device a wallet and identity to transact autonomously (e.g., a fridge ordering milk).

### DePIN Networks
Incentivizing the deployment of physical hardware (sensors, hotspots) by rewarding operators with tokens.

### Supply Chain Verification
Hardware wallets and chips that cryptographically sign data at the source.

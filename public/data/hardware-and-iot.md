## The Opportunity

IoT networks&mdash;spanning smart wearables, homes, vehicles, factories, and cities&mdash;depend on centralized clouds and intermediaries for identity, access, and payments. This dependence creates privacy risks, data silos, and single points of failure. Business models for device coordination and resource sharing remain underdeveloped, with little transparency or programmability.

## Ideas

- Device identity and authentication - Cryptographic identities for hardware devices that enable secure onboarding, authorization, and lifecycle management without centralized registries
- Auditability and compliance for physical systems - Tamper-evident logs linking physical events to digital records for safety, maintenance, and regulatory reporting
- Machine-to-machine payments - Autonomous payment rails that let devices pay each other for services like bandwidth, energy, compute, or maintenance in real time
- Wearables & personal sensors - Verifiable device identity and signed telemetry with consent-based sharing (to apps, clinicians, insurers), optional pay-for-data incentives or premium discounts

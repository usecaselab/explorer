## The Opportunity

IoT networks—spanning smart wearables, homes, vehicles, factories, and cities—depend on centralized clouds and intermediaries for identity, access, and payments, creating privacy risks, data silos, and single points of failure. Business models for device coordination and resource sharing remain underdeveloped, with little transparency or programmability.

## Ideas

- Wearables & personal sensors - verifiable device identity and signed telemetry with consent-based sharing (to apps, clinicians, insurers), optional pay-for-data incentives or premium discounts

## Projects

- [Ethereum Reality Service](https://www.ers.to/) - linking physical chips to onchain identifiers; also relevant for product passport

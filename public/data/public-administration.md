## The Opportunity

Citizens often face duplicative verification processes, long wait times, paper-based records and limited transparency in how decisions are made. Cross-agency data exchange is inconsistent, making oversight and service delivery costly and error-prone. Corruption and inefficiency thrive where records can be altered or lost and where accountability mechanisms are weak.

## Ideas

- Digital ID - A single, verified identity for citizens that can be used across government services.
- Civil registries - Verifiable birth, death, marriage and residency records accessible across agencies.
- Business registries - Incorporated-business, licensing and beneficial-ownership records with instant verification.
- Land & vehicle titles - Ownership records with lien checks and immutable transfer histories.
- Permitting & case management - Digital workflows for permits, applications and entitlements across agencies.
- Participatory governance - E-voting, participatory budgeting, petitions and citizen consultation platforms anchored on ledger systems.
- Digital public infrastructure (DPI) - Interoperable APIs and secure data-exchanges enabling cross-agency coordination.

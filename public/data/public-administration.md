## Problem

Citizens often face duplicative verification processes, long wait times, paper-based records and limited transparency in how decisions are made. Cross-agency data exchange is inconsistent, making oversight and service delivery costly and error-prone. Corruption and inefficiency thrive where records can be altered or lost and where accountability mechanisms are weak.

---

## Opportunities

- **Digital ID:** A single, verified identity for citizens that can be used across government services.
- **Civil registries:** Verifiable birth, death, marriage and residency records accessible across agencies.
- **Business registries:** Incorporated-business, licensing and beneficial-ownership records with instant verification.
- **Land & vehicle titles:** Ownership records with lien checks and immutable transfer histories.
- **Permitting & case management:** Digital workflows for permits, applications and entitlements across agencies.
- **Participatory governance:** E-voting, participatory budgeting, petitions and citizen consultation platforms anchored on ledger systems.
- **Digital public infrastructure (DPI):** Interoperable APIs and secure data-exchanges enabling cross-agency coordination.

## Emerging Trends

Governments are undergoing digital disruption and also smaller budgets which increase a need for digital solutions. Digital Public Goods and Infrastructure are also gaining recognition from institutional and global governing entities

- Increased demand for citizen-centric public services, data interoperability and cross-agency automation.
- Government digital ID initiatives ([eIDAS/](https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/eidas-regulation)[EU Digital Identity](https://ec.europa.eu/digital-building-blocks/sites/spaces/EUDIGITALIDENTITYWALLET/pages/915931811/The%2BEuropean%2BDigital%2BIdentity%2BRegulation) regulation)
    - [Zug Digital ID](https://ezug.ch/en/) - identity system in Switzerland, offering residents digital access to government services and supporting functionalities like e-bike borrowing and municipal voting
- Participatory deliberation tech & experiments: [pol.is](http://pol.is), [vTaiwan](https://info.vtaiwan.tw/) / [g0v](https://g0v.tw/intl/en/) ([Audrey Tang](https://time.com/6979012/audrey-tang-interview-plurality-democracy/)), RadicalXChange

## Intervention Ideas

- Any kind of registry for real estate, vehicles, etc. that need tamper-resistance and public traceability (See California Avalanche DMV registry)
- Hackathon/Co-design sprints and workshops
- [Propel AI Residency](https://docs.google.com/document/d/19Q-Dp0vmQwXbhTGYHpuadxHPzAehc6HGU66EM_tN0k4/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.ofd9cpd1f3sg) to create AI-first digital services.

## Enablers / Blockers

- **Institutional inertia:** Government bureaucracies and legacy systems are slow to adopt new protocols, which slows network effects and system interoperability. Without cross-agency coordination and willingness to change processes, blockchain-enabled e-governance will struggle.
- **Legal recognition of smart contracts and digital credentials:** Many jurisdictions lack clear legal frameworks recognising blockchain-based credentials, smart contracts or on-chain registration systems. Without legal validity of digital credentials and records, governments may not trust or adopt them.
- **Interoperability & legacy system integration:** Existing public-administration systems differ widely; ensuring new ledger-based services integrate smoothly is challenging. If systems cannot talk to each other or legacy data cannot be migrated, the value of shared infrastructure falls short.

## Why It Matters for Ethereum

By anchoring identity, digital credentials, registries and cross-agency data flows on-chain, Ethereum enables government services that are more efficient, transparent and auditable. As citizens demand smoother public-services, governments need interoperable infrastructure.

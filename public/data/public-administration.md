# Public Administration

## Problem

Citizens often face duplicative verification processes, long wait times, paper-based records and limited transparency in how decisions are made. Cross-agency data exchange is inconsistent, making oversight and service delivery costly and error-prone. Corruption and inefficiency thrive where records can be altered or lost and where accountability mechanisms are weak.

## Opportunities

- **Digital ID:** A single, verified identity for citizens that can be used across government services.
- **Civil registries:** Verifiable birth, death, marriage and residency records accessible across agencies.
- **Business registries:** Incorporated-business, licensing and beneficial-ownership records with instant verification.
- **Land & vehicle titles:** Ownership records with lien checks and immutable transfer histories.
- **Permitting & case management:** Digital workflows for permits, applications and entitlements across agencies.
- **Participatory governance:** E-voting, participatory budgeting, petitions and citizen consultation platforms anchored on ledger systems.
- **Digital public infrastructure (DPI):** Interoperable APIs and secure data-exchanges enabling cross-agency coordination.

## Intervention Ideas

- Any kind of registry for real estate, vehicles, etc. that need tamper-resistance and public traceability (See California Avalanche DMV registry)
- Hackathon/Co-design sprints and workshops
- [Propel AI Residency](https://docs.google.com/document/d/19Q-Dp0vmQwXbhTGYHpuadxHPzAehc6HGU66EM_tN0k4/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.ofd9cpd1f3sg) to create AI-first digital services.

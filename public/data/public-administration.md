# Public Administration

## The Opportunity
Government services are often bureaucratic, paper-heavy, and slow. Citizens face friction in obtaining permits, licenses, and benefits. Lack of transparency in administrative processes breeds distrust.

## Ideas

### Digital Citizen Identity
Secure, portable digital identities for citizens to access government services without repetitive paperwork.

### Automated Permitting
Smart contracts that automatically issue permits (e.g., for construction or business) once all objective criteria are met and verified.

### Asset Registries
Moving vehicle, land, and business registries to a blockchain to prevent fraud and speed up transfers.

### Transparent Voting
Verifiable, audit-friendly voting systems for local consultations and referendums.

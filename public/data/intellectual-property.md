## The Opportunity

Intellectual property systems—covering patents, copyrights, and trademarks—are fragmented, slow, and costly. Licensing often relies on one-time fees instead of usage-based models, leaving inventors undercompensated and innovation underfunded. Global variations in law, opaque registries, and expensive enforcement limit access, while creators and small innovators struggle to monetize rights fairly.

## Ideas

- Smart contracts for usage-based, automated licensing and royalty payments - Automate royalty collection and distribution based on actual usage metrics.
- Onchain registration for copyright, patents, and trademarks - Immutable, timestamped proof of creation and ownership.
- Tokenized IP assets - Fractional ownership, financing, and trading of intellectual property rights.
- Licensing pools and collective rights management - Simplify multi-party licensing agreements.
- Cross-industry interoperability - Enable IP licensing across IoT, media, healthcare, and scientific research.
- Proof of existence - Tamper-proof records such as lab books or drafts to strengthen "first to invention" claims.

# Intellectual Property

## The Opportunity
Registering IP is expensive, slow, and jurisdiction-bound. Creators struggle to monetize their work globally or track its usage. The current patent system favors large corporations over individual inventors.

## Ideas

### IP-NFTs
Representing patents, copyrights, or trademarks as NFTs to allow for easy licensing, fractional ownership, and liquidity.

### on-chain Royalty Standards
Universal standards (like EIP-2981) that ensure creators receive a percentage of secondary sales across all marketplaces.

### Patent Pools
DAOs that collectively own and license patents, reducing litigation risks and lowering costs for members.

### Proof of Creation
Timestamping creative works on a blockchain to establish a verifiable date of creation for copyright claims.

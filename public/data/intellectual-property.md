# Problem

Intellectual property systems—covering patents, copyrights, and trademarks—are fragmented, slow, and costly. Licensing often relies on one-time fees instead of usage-based models, leaving inventors undercompensated and innovation underfunded. Global variations in law, opaque registries, and expensive enforcement limit access, while creators and small innovators struggle to monetize rights fairly.

# **Opportunities**

- Smart contracts for usage-based, automated licensing and royalty payments
- Onchain registration for copyright, patents, and trademarks
- Tokenized IP assets enabling fractional ownership, financing, and trading
- Licensing pools and collective rights management
- Cross-industry interoperability for IP across IoT, media, healthcare, and scientific research
- Proof of existence / tamper proof records such as lab books or drafts to strengthen “first to invention” rather than just registration claims.

# **Emerging Trends**

- Open science and patent commons for faster innovation (Open COVID Pledge, CERN Open Hardware)
- AI-generated content driving demand for new IP frameworks
- Usage-based and subscription licensing models replacing static fee structures

# Blockers

- Difficulty bridging off-chain legal contracts with onchain enforcement
- High institutional inertia and entrenched intermediaries in patent and copyright offices

## The Opportunity

Healthcare suffers from siloed data, opaque supply chains, and misaligned incentives. Patient records are fragmented, billing is complex, and counterfeit drugs undermine trust. Clinical trials are costly and inefficient, and innovators struggle with access to funding and data. Patients, providers, and researchers lack verifiable, interoperable systems to manage, share, and build on sensitive health information securely.

## Ideas

- Health record systems enabling secure, patient-owned data and cross-provider interoperability
- Prescription and pharmaceutical marketplaces with counterfeit resistance and traceability
- Fitness and wearables data exchanges rewarding patients for contributing insights
- Attestation frameworks for medical testing, clinical trials, and peer review
- Crowdsourced and token-incentivized clinical trials with AI-driven analysis
- IP-NFTs for biotech discoveries and molecule ownership, enabling new R&D finance models
- Insurance - automated claims, instant reimbursements, fraud prevention, and transparent coverage

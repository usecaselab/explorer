# Health & Bio

## The Opportunity
Patient data is fragmented across providers. Research is slowed by data privacy concerns. DeSci (Decentralized Science) aims to fix funding and collaboration in biology.

## Ideas

### Patient-Owned Records
Encrypted health records stored on IPFS where patients control access keys and grant temporary permission to doctors.

### IP-NFTs
Tokenizing intellectual property of biomedical research to fund early-stage drug discovery.

### DAO-Funded Research
Collectives that pool funds to sponsor research into rare diseases neglected by big pharma.

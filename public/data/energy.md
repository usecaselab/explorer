# Energy

## The Opportunity
Energy grids are centralizing and inefficient. As renewable sources like solar become common, we need peer-to-peer trading systems to balance local grids without relying solely on utility monopolies.

## Ideas

### P2P Energy Trading
Neighborhood microgrids where households with solar panels can automatically sell excess power to neighbors.

### REC Tokenization
Renewable Energy Certificates issued on-chain to prevent double-counting and increase liquidity in carbon markets.

### DePIN for Energy
Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks that reward users for contributing battery storage or grid stabilization services.

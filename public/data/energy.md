## The Opportunity

Power systems are shifting to renewables and electrification (e.g., rooftop solar, EVs, heat pumps), which creates sharper peaks and local bottlenecks that are harder to manage with today’s tools. Small, distributed projects struggle to get financed and built because permits are slow, incentives are fragmented, and future cashflows are uncertain&mdash;making it hard to bundle many sites. Nuclear new build and SMRs face long licensing timelines, high upfront risk, and supply-chain quality hurdles, with limited end-to-end tracking for fuel and waste. Environmental claims&mdash;RECs, carbon intensity, green hydrogen&mdash;are hard to verify end-to-end, so double-counting and “greenwashing” remain risks. Meanwhile, as grids add automation and billions of connected devices, cyber-physical risk rises without common ways to authenticate devices and keep tamper-evident records of real energy flows and control actions.

## Ideas

- Peer-to-peer energy markets - Local energy trading and microgrids that let participants buy, sell, and balance electricity directly with one another
- Tokenized renewable financing - Onchain funding models for solar, storage, and community energy projects that track ownership, cash flows, and performance
- Demand coordination - Incentive systems that reward households and businesses for shifting load, sharing energy, and smoothing demand peaks
- Carbon and sustainability accounting - Digital measurement and tracking of emissions, renewable generation, and environmental impact tied to energy production
- Distributed grid automation - Decentralized control systems for monitoring and coordinating grid assets to reduce outages and cyber-physical vulnerabilities

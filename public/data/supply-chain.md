# Supply Chain

## Problem

Global supply chains today are highly fragmented, largely paper-driven and prone to costly delays. Manufacturers, suppliers, logistics providers, customs agencies and retailers operate across disconnected systems, which creates blind spots that hinder fraud detection, error-correction and real-time coordination. Settlement and financing processes frequently lag behind physical shipments by weeks, creating liquidity gaps. At the same time regulatory compliance and certification demands (for sustainability, safety, customs) add further friction to already complex flows.

## Opportunities

Digitally-native, interoperable supply chain infrastructure for traceability, financing, identity and settlement so that goods, services and value flow with visibility and trust.

- **Smart contract payments:** Conditional release of funds tied to IoT or oracle-verified delivery/severity events.
- **Trade finance:** Tokenized invoices, letters of credit and receivables that can be sold, collateralized or traded.
- **Customs & compliance:** Shared ledgers for real-time clearance, tariff mechanics and document exchange between jurisdictions.
- **Traceability & certification:** Append-only product provenance and certification records (e.g., organic, fair trade, carbon tracking).
- **Inventory management:** Tokenized SKUs and warehouse receipts that permit programmatic tracking, financing and movement of goods.
- **Recommerce & circular flows:** Verifiable product-history for resale, recycling and sustainability reporting.
- **Open supply-chains:** Enabling coordination among independent farmers, artisans and open-hardware producers outside corporate platforms.
- **Electronic Bill of Lading:** Replacing paper document of title with NFT-like digital representation of title and transfer rights.

## Intervention Ideas

- Related to [Digital Product Passport - Tokenizing Consumer Goods](Digital%20Product%20Passport%20-%20Tokenizing%20Consumer%20Goo%2027ad34f360e48057b679e26f7592a7be.md)
- Build a **tokenized trade-finance marketplace** where invoices/receivables from upstream suppliers are represented as transferable tokens and integrated with settlement logic.
- Prototype **smart-contract payments linked to IoT delivery events**: e.g., shipment verified → payment automatically released.
- Pilot circular-economy flows using verifiable product-history minted as on-chain assets enabling resale, recycling and certification tracking.
- Roll out programs for small-tier suppliers (farmers, artisans) to onboard into open supply-chain networks using verifiable credentials and tokenized participation.

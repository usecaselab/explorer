# Supply Chain

## The Opportunity
Global trade involves complex webs of suppliers, endless paper trails, and little visibility. Blockchain provides a shared source of truth for all parties.

## Ideas

### Provenance Tracking
Verifying the origin of luxury goods (diamonds, bags) to prevent counterfeiting.

### Bill of Lading Digitization
Turning paper trade documents into NFTs to speed up customs and trade finance.

### Cold Chain Monitoring
IoT sensors writing temperature data to the blockchain to prove perishables didn't spoil during transit.

## The Opportunity

Global supply chains today are highly fragmented, largely paper-driven, and prone to costly delays. Manufacturers, suppliers, logistics providers, customs agencies, and retailers operate across disconnected systems, which creates blind spots that hinder fraud detection, error-correction, and real-time coordination. Settlement and financing processes frequently lag behind physical shipments by weeks, creating liquidity gaps. At the same time, regulatory compliance and certification demands (such as those for sustainability, safety, and customs) add further friction to already complex flows.

## Ideas

- Smart contract payments - Conditional release of funds tied to IoT or oracle-verified delivery/severity events
- Trade finance - Tokenized invoices, letters of credit, and receivables that can be sold, collateralized or traded
- Customs & compliance - Shared ledgers for real-time clearance, tariff mechanics and document exchange between jurisdictions
- Traceability & certification - Append-only product provenance and certification records (e.g., organic, fair trade, carbon tracking)
- Inventory management - Tokenized SKUs and warehouse receipts that permit programmatic tracking, financing and movement of goods
- Recommerce & circular flows - Verifiable product-history for resale, recycling and sustainability reporting
- Open supply-chains - Enabling coordination among independent farmers, artisans and open-hardware producers outside corporate platforms
- Electronic Bill of Lading - Replacing paper document of title with NFT-like digital representation of title and transfer rights

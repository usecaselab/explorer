## The Opportunity

Mobilizing resources for aid and social support is often slow, opaque and costly, especially at the last mile. Fragmented registries, manual eligibility checks and multiple intermediary layers increase leakage and delays, particularly in crisis contexts. Cross-border constraints and banking frictions limit reach to vulnerable and unbanked populations. Verification and impact-reporting are inconsistent, making it difficult for donors and agencies to trace funds to outcomes while also protecting recipient privacy.

## Ideas

- Transparent donation flows & grant disbursements - Onchain tracking of donor funds, real-time visibility into flow and allocation, reducing leakage and improving trust
- Direct cash-transfer programs - Use of digital wallets, crypto or tokenized transfers to reach vulnerable or unbanked populations with minimal intermediaries
- Impact certificates & tokenization - Verifiable records of outcomes (e.g., service delivery, participation) that support accountability and impact-reporting
- Identity & banking for displaced people - Portable identities and wallet access for refugees, migrant workers or displaced communities, enabling access to services and funding
- Outcome-based funding - Smart contracts that release funds only when pre-defined metrics or milestones are met
- Decentralized coordination for social-services actors - Infrastructure enabling NGOs, volunteers and communities to coordinate service delivery, funding and verification
- UBI - Direct-to-recipient distribution mechanisms that provided recurring, automated universal basic income payments, using decentralized identity and smart contracts to reduce adminsitrative overhead

# Philanthropy & Social Services

## The Opportunity
Charity suffers from lack of trust—donors don't know if funds reach the target. Smart contracts ensure programmable donation flows and accountability.

## Ideas

### Direct Cash Transfers
Crypto donations sent directly to the wallets of people in need, bypassing NGOs and administrative fees.

### Conditional Giving
Funds that are only released when verifiable milestones (e.g., building complete, trees planted) are met.

### Impact Certificates
NFTs that represent a verifiable unit of positive impact (e.g., 1 ton of carbon removed), sold to funders.

# Insurance

## The Opportunity
Traditional insurance is opaque, slow to pay out, and often misaligned with policyholders. Smart contracts allow for automated, trustless coverage.

## Ideas

### Parametric Flight Insurance
Policies that payout automatically if flight data shows a delay over X hours.

### DeFi Protocol Cover
Community-pooled insurance to protect against smart contract hacks or stablecoin de-pegging.

### Mutuals
Member-owned insurance pools where claims are voted on by the community or determined by impartial arbiters.

# Insurance

### Problem

The insurance lifecycle remains manual, slow, and built on low-trust workflows. Administrative overhead across underwriting, policy administration and claims can consume 25–40 % of premiums. Carriers, brokers, reinsurers and regulators operate in silos, fragmenting data and slowing verification. Claims are often adversarial, opaque and difficult to audit. Capital is stuck in conservative reserves, limiting coverage for long-tail or emerging risks.

Blockchain-insurance research confirms that high transaction costs, trust gaps and fragmentation are among the central pain points.

### Opportunities

Automating underwriting, payouts, capital flows and risk sharing onchain to reduce cost, increase transparency, and open new insurance models.

- **Parametric policies:** Smart-contract triggered claims (weather, flight delay, cargo) eliminate long verification loops.
- **Onchain risk pools & reinsurance marketplaces:** Transparent, composable capital pools with tokenized participation allow wider investor access.
- **Tokenized reserves & transparent solvency reporting:** Onchain reserve tracking enables real-time visibility and better risk pricing.
- **Tokenized policies for resale:** Policies become tradable contracts, enabling secondary markets, swapping risk profiles and unlocking liquidity.
- Potential for peer-to-peer mutual models anchored onchain, enabling community underwriting of niche risks. ([MAPFRE](https://www.mapfre.com/en/insights/innovation/blockchain-in-insurance-risks-and-opportunities/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

## The Opportunity

The insurance lifecycle remains manual, slow, and built on low-trust workflows. Administrative overhead across underwriting, policy administration, and claims can consume 25–40 % of premiums. Carriers, brokers, reinsurers, and regulators operate in silos, fragmenting data and slowing verification. Claims are often adversarial, opaque, and difficult to audit. Capital is stuck in conservative reserves, limiting coverage for long-tail or emerging risks.

Blockchain-based insurance research confirms that high transaction costs, trust gaps, and fragmentation are among the central pain points.

## Ideas

- Parametric policies - Smart-contract triggered claims (weather, flight delay, cargo) eliminate long verification loops
- Onchain risk pools & reinsurance marketplaces - Transparent, composable capital pools with tokenized participation allow wider investor access
- Tokenized reserves & transparent solvency reporting - Onchain reserve tracking enables real-time visibility and better risk pricing
- Tokenized policies for resale - Policies become tradable contracts, enabling secondary markets, swapping risk profiles and unlocking liquidity

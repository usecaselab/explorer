# CityTech

## The Opportunity
Cities struggle with transparent resource allocation, citizen participation in governance, and efficient infrastructure management. Legacy systems are siloed and prone to corruption.

## Ideas

### Onchain Voting Systems

Secure, transparent voting for municipal decisions using ZK-proofs for privacy and verifiable results.

### Transparent Budgeting

Real-time tracking of city funds and expenditures on a public ledger to increase accountability.

### Land Registry on IPFS

Immutable property records stored on decentralized storage to prevent fraud and speed up transfers.

### IoT Infrastructure Payments

Autonomous micropayments for smart city infrastructure usage like EV charging or parking.

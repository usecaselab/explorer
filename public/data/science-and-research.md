*Overlaps with Health & Bio

## Problem

Scientific research is strained by misaligned incentives and weak accountability. Funding institutions favor incremental rather than high-risk or interdisciplinary work. Peer review is often slow and inconsistent, the reproducibility crisis continues to erode confidence in published results, and many contributions like data generation, reviews or replication receive limited recognition. Clinical trials and applied R&D suffer from compliance burdens and fragmented data coordination. These systemic issues hamper innovation, reduce reward for critical tasks and make it difficult to coordinate large collaborative efforts efficiently.

## Opportunities

Ethereum can support interoperable protocols that recognize contributions, ensure provenance, and align funding and governance for interdisciplinary science.

- **Credentials & impact certificates:** Verifiable recognition of contributions, reproducibility outcomes and downstream impact (for example via [Hypercerts](https://www.hypercerts.org/)).
- **Crowdfunding and collective ownership of IP:** Tokenized IP-NFTs (for example via Molecule, [Bio.xyz](http://Bio.xyz)) enable shared ownership of research outcomes.
- **Publishing reform:** Open systems for publishing, peer review, and portable researcher reputation (for example ResearchHub).
- **Reusable datasets & provenance:** Decentralized storage and provenance for research data to boost reuse and integrity (for example Seal Storage).
- **Clinical trials & milestone-based funding:** Smart-contract payments tied to data sharing, milestones and auditing in trials.
- **Knowledge graphs & connected science:** Decentralized knowledge graphs linking data, AI and researchers to reveal hidden connections (e.g. via [DeSci World](https://desci.world/) or [SciGraph](https://github.com/SciGraph/SciGraph)).
- **Prediction markets & crowdsourced innovation:** Incentivized mechanisms for funding and discovering novel research directions.

## Emerging Trends

- The rise of **Focused Research Organizations (FROs)** and ARPA-style institutions that fund high-risk/high-reward science, as well as fund R&D that does not fit neatly into public nor private funding boxes and/or benefits.
- Open Science mandates (for example via the National Institutes of Health and the European Commission) requiring data sharing and reproducibility.
- Improved infrastructure for open data, knowledge graphs and decentralized publishing.

## Leverage Points

- Lots of science research is experiencing funding cuts, intervention opportunity here of [bio.xyz](http://bio.xyz)-style crowdfunding. Any other successful funding models?
- Pilot simulation of prediction-market-based funding for high-risk interdisciplinary science, using decentralized tokens and reputation mechanisms.

## Enablers / Blockers

- **Institutional inertia:** Universities, publishers and funding agencies are slow to adopt new systems, which limits network effects and protocol diffusion. Traditional institutions dominate research workflows; shifting them requires significant coordination and value-proposition.
- **Mechanism design - recognition & reward model:** Many protocols exist but lack integration into researcher career systems, making incentive alignment weak. Without recognition for data-generators, reviewers or replicators, adoption of new contribution tracking is hampered.

## Why It Matters for Ethereum

By anchoring contribution credentials, provenance logs, publication workflows and funding governance, Ethereum enables a shift from opaque, incremental science to more transparent, collaborative, high-impact research  models of publishing, ownership and funding.

# Science & Research

## The Opportunity
Misaligned incentives favor incremental work over high-risk research. Peer review is slow, reproducibility crisis persists, and contributions like data generation receive limited recognition.

## Ideas

### Impact Certificates
NFTs or tokens that represent a verifiable unit of positive impact or research contribution, allowing funders to retroactively reward useful work.

### IP-NFTs
Tokenizing intellectual property rights of research to allow fractional ownership, liquidity, and easier licensing for early-stage science.

### Open Publishing Reform
Moving academic publishing to decentralized platforms where peer review is transparent, incentivized, and access is not gated by paywalls.

### Reusable Datasets
Standardizing data formats and using decentralized storage to ensure raw research data is accessible, verifiable, and immutable for reproduction.

### Clinical Trial Automation
Using smart contracts to manage patient consent, data collection, and automatic payouts for trial participants.

### Knowledge Graphs
Decentralized, interoperable networks of citations and data points that connect research findings across disciplines.

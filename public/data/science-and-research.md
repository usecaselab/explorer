## The Opportunity

Scientific research is strained by misaligned incentives and weak accountability. Funding institutions favor incremental rather than high-risk or interdisciplinary work. Peer review is often slow and inconsistent, the reproducibility crisis continues to erode confidence in published results, and many contributions like data generation, reviews, or replication receive limited recognition. Clinical trials and applied R&D suffer from compliance burdens and fragmented data coordination. These systemic issues hamper innovation, reduce reward for critical tasks and make it difficult to coordinate large collaborative efforts efficiently.

## Ideas

- Credentials & impact certificates - Verifiable recognition of contributions, reproducibility outcomes and downstream impact
- IP-NFTs - Crowdfunding and collective ownership of IP
- Publishing reform - Open systems for publishing, peer review, and portable researcher reputation
- Reusable datasets & provenance - Decentralized storage and provenance for research data to boost reuse and integrity
- Clinical trials & milestone-based funding - Smart-contract payments tied to data sharing, milestones and auditing in trials
- Knowledge graphs & connected science - Decentralized knowledge graphs linking data, AI, and researchers to reveal hidden connections
- Prediction markets & crowdsourced innovation - Incentivized mechanisms for funding and discovering novel research directions

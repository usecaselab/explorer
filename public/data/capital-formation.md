# Capital Formation

## The Opportunity
Raising capital for projects, especially public goods, is difficult. Traditional VC is exclusive; crowdfunding lacks accountability.

## Ideas

### Quadratic Funding

Matching funds distribution method that prioritizes the number of contributors over amount given.

### Dominant Assurance Contracts

Crowdfunding models that refund participants with a bonus if the goal isn't met, incentivizing contribution.

### Retroactive Public Goods Funding

Rewards for projects that have already demonstrated value to the ecosystem rather than speculative grants.

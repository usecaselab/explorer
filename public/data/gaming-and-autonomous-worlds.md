## The Opportunity

Most digital games today depend on closed servers and proprietary economies that restrict player control, transparency, and long-term viability. Items, progress, and in-game currencies can vanish when platforms change business models or shut down. Anti-cheat systems are opaque and often ineffective, and “open modding” rarely extends to real ownership, true creator monetization, or cross-platform interoperability. As AI-driven agents, community-run servers, and hybrid game worlds emerge, the traditional server-centric model struggles to support fairness, state sharing, and durable worlds beyond a single operator.

The broader concern is that many blockchain gaming efforts today are speculative or extractive (play-to-earn models) rather than delivering positive-sum outcomes or coordination-enhancing gameplay.

## Ideas

- Verifiable core loops - Onchain state and verifiable randomness ensure transparency in moves, scores, loot drops, and tournaments, with zk-proofs verifying off-chain elements without revealing secrets
- Player-owned assets & markets - Truly portable items/currency with minimal fees, rentals, AMM-driven markets, escrowed prize pools&mdash;shifting power from platforms to players
- UGC & mod royalties - Tokenized blueprints, maps or mods permit automatic revenue splits, cross-client recognition, and creator-driven extension of game logic
- Shared worlds - Composable “physics” contracts&mdash;terrain, crafting, combat logic&mdash;that multiple clients or shards can read/write, allowing persistent worlds that outlast any one operator
- Agent-native gameplay - Walleted NPCs and bots with budgets, onchain quests and verifiable completion proofs enable autonomous coordination of game worlds
- Esports & leagues - Transparent tournament brackets, provable anti-cheat attestations, instant rule-based payouts reduce overhead and disputes
- Games as coordination infrastructure - Onchain worlds could serve non-entertainment roles, like governance simulations, public-goods funding mechanisms, or training ecosystems for social cooperation or resource allocation

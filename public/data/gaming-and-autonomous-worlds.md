# Gaming & Autonomous Worlds

## The Opportunity
Gamers pour time and money into virtual assets they don't truly own. Games are walled gardens where interoperability is impossible and developers control the economy.

## Ideas

### True Asset Ownership
In-game items as NFTs that can be sold, traded, or moved to other games/marketplaces.

### Autonomous Worlds
Game logic that lives entirely on-chain, allowing the community to build mods and extensions that are permanent and permissionless.

### Composable Loot
Items that have base stats on-chain but can be interpreted differently by different game front-ends.

# Social

## Problem

Today’s social platforms concentrate power in a small number of large companies. These intermediaries control how attention is monetized, own the user-data silos, dictate recommendation and moderation algorithms, and can de-platform individuals and communities at will. At the same time, users and creators face poor data portability, opaque algorithmic decisions, and limited monetization options. Meanwhile misinformation, spam, and bots flood feeds, reducing trust, and creators struggle with arbitrary rules and revenue-share models.

## Opportunities

Ethereum can enable decentralized social networks with portable identity, verifiable reputation, creator monetization and transparent governance to shift power away from centralized platforms.

- **Portable social identity:** On-chain handles and profiles that work across multiple apps and enable users to carry their identity and data
- **Verifiable reputation:** Attestations for follows, engagement, contributions and community participation that are portable
- **Creator & content tokenization:** Gated access, token-based benefits, revenue-share models for creators and their communities
- **Creator monetization:** Subscriptions, tipping, revenue splits, micro-payments embedded in content platforms
- **Content provenance:** Signed posts and media receipts to combat impersonation, fraud and deepfakes — for example notarizing photos/videos/hardware signed + hash on-chain.
- **Moderation & bot-detection mechanisms:** Community notes, reputation-weighted signals, proof-of-humanity checks to reduce spam and manipulation
- **Credential/token-gated groups & curation mechanisms:** For example grads of X, attendee networks, token-curated registries (TCRs), staking games, curated communities
- **Crowdfunding & incentivizing real-world actions:** Mechanisms to tie social participation to offline actions (POIDH – proof of impact/delivery in human domains)

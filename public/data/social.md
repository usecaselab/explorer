## Problem

Today’s social platforms concentrate power in a small number of large companies. These intermediaries control how attention is monetized, own the user-data silos, dictate recommendation and moderation algorithms, and can de-platform individuals and communities at will. At the same time, users and creators face poor data portability, opaque algorithmic decisions, and limited monetization options. Meanwhile misinformation, spam, and bots flood feeds, reducing trust, and creators struggle with arbitrary rules and revenue-share models.

## Opportunities

Ethereum can enable decentralized social networks with portable identity, verifiable reputation, creator monetization and transparent governance to shift power away from centralized platforms.

- **Portable social identity:** On-chain handles and profiles that work across multiple apps and enable users to carry their identity and data
- **Verifiable reputation:** Attestations for follows, engagement, contributions and community participation that are portable
- **Creator & content tokenization:** Gated access, token-based benefits, revenue-share models for creators and their communities
- **Creator monetization:** Subscriptions, tipping, revenue splits, micro-payments embedded in content platforms
- **Content provenance:** Signed posts and media receipts to combat impersonation, fraud and deepfakes — for example notarizing photos/videos/hardware signed + hash on-chain.
- **Moderation & bot-detection mechanisms:** Community notes, reputation-weighted signals, proof-of-humanity checks to reduce spam and manipulation
- **Credential/token-gated groups & curation mechanisms:** For example grads of X, attendee networks, token-curated registries (TCRs), staking games, curated communities
- **Crowdfunding & incentivizing real-world actions:** Mechanisms to tie social participation to offline actions (POIDH – proof of impact/delivery in human domains)

## Emerging Trends

The social media landscape is being reshaped by several concurrent shifts:

- Short-form and livestream commerce (creators selling in-stream)
- Creator-tooling (platforms like Kajabi, Patreon) bundling CRM, storefront, and analytics capabilities
- AI moderation tools
- AI-driven content surge making provenance, origin, identity verification more critical

## Leverage Points

- [Bluesky/AT Protocol](https://docs.bsky.app/docs/advanced-guides/atproto) (Metamask has been talking to them but not much overlap between this DWeb space and crypto yet though both are aligned)
- [New Public](https://newpublic.org/), non profit working on new social media primitives, also developing a community of practice
- [Social Web Foundation](https://socialwebfoundation.org/) - Direct contact to founder Tom Coates, they aim to bridge between current incumbent players (Facebook, Twitter) and the fediverse, web3, etc.
    - Reference schematics for standardized portable social identity on-chain (e.g. self-sovereign identity + social handle binding).
    - Define data schemas for reputation attestations, provenance receipts, media signature metadata.
    - Test business models for creator revenue and revenue-sharing that are compliant across jurisdictions (possible now with stablecoins?).
        - Pilot token-gated creator communities with integrated subscription + revenue-share models embedded in smart contracts. e.g. writers on Substack have expressed interest in being paid with % of subscriber profits, etc from their own work, rather than a monthly subscription/having multiple ways to geenrate revenue than just monthly paid subs.
        - x402 also introduces micro-payment possibilities that we could trial with companies like Substack, Medium, etc. Personally I’m a big fan of [Ghost](https://ghost.org/), completely open source, and solid team it seems.

## Enablers / Blockers

- **Platform network-effect:** The massive network effects of incumbent platforms make migration or decentralized adoption difficult
- **Securities law:** Tokenization of creator revenue-sharing may trigger securities laws, complicating enforceability across jurisdictions
- **Scalability & User Experience:** Onchain identity, reputation and content-provenance systems must scale and offer seamless UX to compete with Web2 alternatives

## Why It Matters for Ethereum

Ethereum enables social networks where users and creators retain control over data, reputation is portable, and monetization capabilities are easier to leverage directly by individuals and are transparent. This use case offers a high-leverage opportunity for Ethereum to serve as the trust and coordination infrastructure behind next-generation creator economies and social networks.

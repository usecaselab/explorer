# Social

## The Opportunity
Centralized platforms control monetization, data, algorithms, and moderation. Users face poor portability, opaque decisions, and limited monetization.

## Ideas

### Portable Social Identity
Users own their profile, social graph, and content, allowing them to move seamlessly between different applications without losing their audience.

### Verifiable Reputation
On-chain history and attestations that prove a user's reliability or expertise without relying on a central platform's opaque algorithm.

### Creator Tokenization
Allowing creators to issue their own tokens or NFTs, giving fans a stake in their success and direct access to exclusive content.

### Content Provenance
Cryptographically signing posts and media to prove authorship and combat misinformation or deepfakes.

### Bot Detection
Using economic stakes, web-of-trust models, or zero-knowledge proofs to distinguish real humans from automated scripts.

### Token-Gated Groups
Communities where access is automatically granted or revoked based on the ownership of specific tokens or NFTs.

### On-chain Revenue Splits
Smart contracts that automatically distribute tips, subscriptions, or ad revenue to all contributors and platforms involved in a piece of content.

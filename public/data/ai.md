# AI

## The Opportunity
AI development is currently highly centralized within a few "Big Tech" firms that control the hardware (GPUs), the data, and the models. This creates single points of failure, censorship risks, and misaligned incentives. Combining AI with Ethereum's trustless infrastructure enables decentralized model training, verifiable inference (ZKML), and autonomous AI agents that can own capital and transact on-chain.

## Ideas

### ZKML (Zero-Knowledge Machine Learning)
Proving that a specific AI model was run on specific input data to produce a specific result, without revealing the model's weights or the raw data.

### AI Agent Wallets
Giving LLM-based agents their own Ethereum accounts (via Account Abstraction) so they can pay for their own compute, hire other agents, or manage treasuries.

### Decentralized Model Training
Incentivized networks where users contribute idle GPU power to train open-source models in exchange for protocol tokens.

### Data Provenance for LLMs
Using the blockchain to track the origin of training data, ensuring creators are compensated when their work is used to train commercial models.

### Adversarial Model Testing
Smart contracts that reward users for finding "jailbreaks" or biases in deployed AI models.

## The Opportunity

AI systems are increasingly powerful but remain opaque, centralized, and controlled by a handful of large corporations. Users lack visibility into model training data, inference processes, and decision-making logic. There's no verifiable way to audit AI outputs, track provenance, or ensure fair compensation to data contributors. As AI agents become autonomous actors in digital ecosystems, they need secure identities, wallets, and verifiable credentials to participate in economic activities.

## Ideas

- Verifiable AI inference - Onchain proofs that a specific model produced a specific output, enabling accountability and auditability
- Decentralized AI training - Federated learning and collaborative model training with cryptographic guarantees and contributor rewards
- AI agent wallets and identity - Autonomous agents with onchain identities that can hold assets, sign transactions, and participate in DAOs
- Model and dataset marketplaces - Tokenized AI models and training datasets with programmable licensing, usage tracking, and royalty distribution
- AI output provenance - Watermarking, signing, and tracking AI-generated content to combat deepfakes and misinformation
- Compute marketplaces - Decentralized GPU networks for AI training and inference with verifiable computation
- AI governance and alignment - Onchain mechanisms for community oversight, bounties for alignment research, and transparent model evaluation

## Examples

- [x402](https://www.x402.org/) - Uses the HTTP 402 status code to let servers charge for API calls or content via on-chain stablecoin payments, so AI agents and humans can pay per request without accounts or API keys
- [ERC-8004](https://www.8004.org/) - Gives AI agents on-chain identity (as NFTs), reputation tracking, and task validation registries so they can discover and trust each other across organizations
- [Virtuals](https://virtuals.io/) - Allows anyone to create an AI agent, tokenize it as an ERC-20, and let others co-own it and share in its revenue
- [elizaOS](https://elizaos.ai/) - Framework for building AI agents that can autonomously post on Twitter, manage Discord/Telegram communities, trade on-chain, and interact with any API
- [Theoriq](https://www.theoriq.ai/) - Lets AI agents team up as swarms to automatically manage DeFi positions, finding yield, rebalancing liquidity, and executing trades across protocols without human intervention
- [Giza](https://www.gizatech.xyz/) - Lets smart contracts use ML models (like price predictors or risk engines) with cryptographic proof that the model actually ran correctly, so DeFi apps can trust AI outputs without trusting the operator
- [Olas](https://olas.network/) - Protocol for building and running multi-agent autonomous services (oracles, keepers, AI bots) that are operated in a decentralized way by multiple independent operators
- [EZKL](https://ezkl.xyz/) - Enables you to prove you ran a specific model on specific data
- [Gensyn](https://www.gensyn.ai/) - Protocol for machine-learning computation that aggregates global computing resources into a single open network that can execute training and other ML workloads

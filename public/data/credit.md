# Credit

## The Opportunity
Access to credit is often gatekept by centralized institutions relying on opaque credit scores. DeFi offers over-collateralized loans, but under-collateralized credit remains a hard problem.

## Ideas

### Soulbound Credit Scores

Non-transferable reputation tokens representing creditworthiness based on on-chain repayment history.

### Social Graph Underwriting

Leveraging web-of-trust connections where peers vouch for borrower reliability.

### Real World Asset Collateral

Tokenizing physical assets like invoices or real estate to secure on-chain loans.

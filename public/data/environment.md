# Environment

## The Opportunity
Environmental markets are fragmented and opaque. Carbon credits are often double-counted or lack verification. Corporations struggle to prove their sustainability claims, and individuals lack incentives to reduce their ecological footprint.

## Ideas

### Tokenized Carbon Credits
Representing carbon offsets as unique tokens to prevent double-spending and ensure transparent retirement of credits.

### Biodiversity Credits
Financial instruments that reward the preservation of specific ecosystems or species, tradable on open markets.

### Regenerative Finance (ReFi)
Economic systems that use money as a tool to solve systemic problems and regenerate communities and natural environments.

### Plastic Tracking
Monitoring plastic waste through the supply chain to ensure it is recycled or disposed of properly.

# Productivity & Collaboration

## The Opportunity
Remote work requires trust. Web3 tools can automate payments, sign contracts, and manage digital identity for distributed teams.

## Ideas

### Crypto-Native Signatures
Using wallet signatures to sign PDF contracts, verifying identity without DocuSign.

### Bounty Networks
Marketplaces where tasks are posted with escrowed crypto rewards, paid out upon successful submission.

### Token-Gated Docs
Collaborative documents that are only accessible to team members holding a specific project token.

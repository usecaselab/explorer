## The Opportunity

Workplace productivity today is dominated by centralized SaaS providers who silo data, control workflows and monetize user information. Teams face lock-in, limited interoperability and opaque governance structures. With remote and global collaboration growing, trust, coordination, and recognition of fair contribution are increasingly challenged. The fragmentation of tooling, lack of shared infrastructure, and reliance on closed platforms lead to costly inefficiencies and barriers to cross-organization collaboration.

## Ideas

- Decentralized workspaces - Shared documents, files and workflows where users control their own data and can seamlessly move between tools.
- Verifiable credentials - Onchain attestations for skills, contributions, participation or peer reviews, enabling portable reputations across organizations.
- Tokenized incentives - Programmatic reward (or penalization) for deep work, task completion and fair contribution could offset reliance on reputation systems controlled by platforms.
- Community-driven collaboration tools - Messaging, video conferencing, and project management governed onchain, enabling transparent governance and shared ownership.
- Code collaboration & peer-governance - P2P versioning and funding for open source, with contributor credentials, governance tokens and transparent reward flows.
- Potential for “collaboration infrastructure” - Ethereum-based protocols could serve as a shared workflow layer across enterprises, enabling plug-and-play modules for documents, identity, governance and contributions.

# Law & Regulation

## The Opportunity
Legal and regulatory systems rely on fragmented workflows with statutes published as prose, slow licensing/compliance checks, and costly audits. Private legal agreements remain manual, slow, and jurisdiction-bound.

## Ideas

### Machine-readable law
Codifying statutes and regulations into executable logic to automate compliance checks and legal reasoning.

### Peer-to-peer certification
Decentralized networks where professionals attest to each other's credentials and skills, reducing reliance on centralized licensing bodies.

### zkKYC compliance proofs
Using zero-knowledge proofs to verify identity or accreditation (e.g., "is over 18", "is accredited investor") without revealing the underlying personal data.

### Smart wills/inheritance
Automated systems that transfer assets to beneficiaries upon verifiable conditions of death or inactivity (dead man's switch).

### Programmable trusts
Trust funds implemented as smart contracts that disburse funds strictly according to pre-programmed logic.

### Decentralized arbitration
Dispute resolution mechanisms that crowdsource rulings from incentivized jurors rather than centralized courts.

### Ricardian contracts
Legal agreements that cryptographically bind a human-readable legal contract with its machine-executable smart contract counterpart.

# Food & Agriculture

## The Opportunity
Supply chains are opaque, making it hard to verify organic claims, fair trade practices, or food safety. Farmers often lack access to insurance and fair financing.

## Ideas

### Supply Chain Traceability
End-to-end tracking of produce from farm to table using immutable logs to prove freshness and origin.

### Parametric Crop Insurance
Smart contracts that automatically pay out farmers based on weather oracle data (e.g., drought or flood) without manual claims processing.

### Regenerative Ag Credits
Tokenizing soil carbon sequestration to pay farmers for sustainable practices.

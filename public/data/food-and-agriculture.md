## The Opportunity

Farmers and small processors operate on thin margins and slow payments, pre-financing inputs without reliable ways to prove weights, grades, residues, or animal welfare at sale; lab results and inspections rarely stay attached to lots. Traceability breaks at handoffs, as lot IDs change, temperature data isn’t captured end-to-end, and records sit in PDFs and supplier portals. This complexity makes recalls, substitutions, and adulteration (e.g., diluted oils, mislabeled seafood) hard to resolve. 

In the middle, grocers and restaurants juggle siloed POS, inventory, and supplier systems&mdash;leading to out-of-stocks, shrink, rebate, and chargeback disputes, and weak links between SKUs/menus and verified origin, allergens, or nutrition. Consumers face labels that are hard to verify and a shelf bias toward ultra-processed, low-cost products because there’s no consistent way to price, reward, and replenish for proven freshness and healthier composition.

## Ideas

- Provenance and traceability systems to ensure food safety and authenticity
- Tokenized assets for crops, land, and livestock to unlock liquidity and investment
- Farmer financing and insurance through onchain credit, microloans, and parametric covers
- Loyalty and incentive systems for regenerative and sustainable practices
- Community and cooperative marketplaces to retain more value locally

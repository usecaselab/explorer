## The Opportunity

Government financial systems and procurement workflows often operate with fragmented ledgers, manual reporting, paper-based contracts, complex supplier networks and opaque bidding processes. Tax records, budget allocations, expenditures and procurement contracts are siloed across agencies, and many procurement cycles suffer from delays, discretion, waste and opportunities for corruption. Citizens and stakeholders lack reliable, real-time visibility into how public funds are collected, allocated, contracted and spent, reducing accountability and trust.

## Ideas

- Crypto tax payment -  Acceptance of tokens and stablecoins for tax obligations, with automatic conversion, reconciliation, and settlement.
- Transparent budget execution - Real-time tracking of allocations, expenditures and variances so citizens and auditors follow funds from appropriation to execution.
- Entitlements & subsidies - Smart-contract-based disbursements that condition payments on verifiable criteria.
- Sovereign & municipal bonds tokenised - Transparent issuance, settlement and coupon-tracking of public debt on-chain.
- Onchain sovereign wealth fund - Transparent governance and real-time tracking of national asset pools.
- Public procurement ledger & smart contracts - Immutable records of tenders, bids, contracts, deliveries and payments spanning the full procurement lifecycle.
- Supplier certification, registration & audit trails - Shared digital passports for suppliers, transparent contract-award workflows and tamper-proof audit-logs.
- Requisition-to-pay ledger integration - Smart-contracts bridging PO issuance, supplier delivery, inspection, invoice and payment in a unified chain.

# Public Finance & Procurement

## The Opportunity
Government financial systems and procurement workflows often operate with fragmented ledgers, manual reporting, paper-based contracts, complex supplier networks and opaque bidding processes. Tax records, budget allocations, expenditures and procurement contracts are siloed across agencies, and many procurement cycles suffer from delays, discretion, waste and opportunities for corruption. Citizens and stakeholders lack reliable, real-time visibility into how public funds are collected, allocated, contracted and spent, reducing accountability and trust.

## Ideas

### Crypto tax payment
Allowing tax liabilities to be settled with digital assets.

### Transparent budget execution
On-chain tracking of government spending to ensure funds reach intended targets.

### Automated UBI/subsidies
Streamlined, programmable distribution of welfare payments and subsidies.

### Tokenized bonds
Issuing government debt as digital tokens for broader access and efficiency.

### Procurement ledgers
Immutable audit trails for government contracts and bidding processes.

### Supplier certification
Verifiable on-chain credentials for government contractors.

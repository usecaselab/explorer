## The Opportunity

Government financial systems and procurement workflows often operate with fragmented ledgers, manual reporting, paper-based contracts, complex supplier networks and opaque bidding processes. Tax records, budget allocations, expenditures, and procurement contracts are siloed across agencies, and many procurement cycles suffer from delays, discretion, waste, and opportunities for corruption. Citizens and stakeholders lack reliable, real-time visibility into how public funds are collected, allocated, contracted, and spent, reducing accountability and trust.

## Ideas

- Transparent budget execution - Real-time tracking of public funds from appropriation to expenditure
- Conditional entitlement disbursements - Subsidy and benefit payments that execute automatically against verifiable eligibility criteria
- Tokenized sovereign & municipal bonds - Onchain issuance, settlement, and coupon tracking of public debt instruments, enabling faster settlement, lower costs, and broader investor access
- Public procurement lifecycle - Transparent record of tenders, bids, evaluations, awards, supplier credentials, deliveries, and payments spanning the full procurement cycle to reduce corruption and enable public audit

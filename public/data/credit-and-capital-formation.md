## The Opportunity

Small and medium enterprises (SMEs) are underserved by traditional finance: credit is scarce, underwriting is costly, and capital markets are inaccessible. Inefficiencies in trade credit, slow processing time, and high intermediary fees constrain SME growth and resilience. Crowdfunding and other alternative financing options remain limited in scale and fail to provide sustained access to affordable capital.

## Ideas

- Trade credit clearing - netting obligations across SME networks
- Commitment pooling - mutualized reserves and cooperative liquidity
- Factoring - tokenized receivables and real-time invoice financing
- Crowdfunding - open platforms for equity, tokens, and community capital
- Crowdlending - peer-to-peer loans with transparent terms
- Microloans - accessible, low-friction capital for underserved entrepreneurs
- Credit unions - blockchain-based cooperative finance models

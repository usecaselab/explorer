# Credit & Capital Formation

## The Opportunity
Small and medium enterprises (SMEs) are underserved by traditional finance: credit is scarce, underwriting is costly, and capital markets are inaccessible. Inefficiencies in trade credit, slow processing time, and high intermediary fees constrain SME growth and resilience. Crowdfunding and other alternative financing options remain limited in scale and fail to provide sustained access to affordable capital.

## Ideas

### Trade credit clearing
Netting obligations across SME networks.

### Commitment pooling
Mutualized reserves and cooperative liquidity.

### Factoring
Tokenized receivables and real-time invoice financing.

### Crowdfunding
Open platforms for equity, tokens, and community capital.

### Crowdlending
Peer-to-peer loans with transparent terms.

### Microloans
Accessible, low-friction capital for underserved entrepreneurs.

### Credit unions
Blockchain-based cooperative finance models.

### Equity tokenization
SMEs can issue tokenized shares, bypassing expensive IPOs and private placements.

# Digital Product Passport - Tokenizing Consumer Goods

### **Problem**

Consumers still struggle to verify whether the products they buy are authentic, safe, ethically sourced, or environmentally sustainable. Today, warranty and repair records are fragmented across retailers and manufacturers, while resale markets remain plagued by counterfeits, stolen goods, and unverifiable listings. Recycling and circular-economy initiatives are hampered by missing data on materials and components.

Without a trusted, portable record that follows a product throughout its life, both consumers and producers face costly information gaps. Provenance data is locked inside proprietary databases, creating friction across sale, resale, warranty, insurance, and recycling ecosystems.

### **Opportunities**

Ethereum can provide a shared infrastructure for **verifiable product identity and lifecycle tracking**. By anchoring product data to onchain tokens, firms can create transparent, tamper-resistant records that persist across owners and marketplaces.

Key opportunities include:

- **Provenance verification:** Ensuring authenticity and preventing counterfeits in luxury goods, art, collectibles, and high-value items.
- **Transparency and compliance:** Publicly attesting to safety, sustainability, and human-rights standards.
- **Lifecycle records:** Capturing warranties, repairs, and maintenance events in a shared ledger accessible to both owners and service providers.
- **Trusted resale markets:** Enabling secondary sales with verifiable ownership and condition histories.
- **New financial models:** Supporting fractionalized ownership, collateralization, or insurance of valuable physical goods.

Together, these capabilities can underpin an open, auditable data layer for global product circulation — linking manufacturing, sale, ownership, and end-of-life recovery.

### **Emerging Trends**

Regulation and market demand are converging toward this model.

- The **EU is mandating Digital Product Passports** across sectors such as construction materials, textiles, electronics, and batteries to promote transparency and circularity.
- **Consumers increasingly demand** proof of authenticity, ethical sourcing, and sustainability.
- **Secondary markets** for luxury goods, electronics, and vehicles are expanding rapidly, driving the need for verifiable provenance.
- **Circular-economy initiatives** emphasize traceable materials and design for recyclability, requiring product-level data continuity.

These pressures are creating strong incentives for interoperable, blockchain-based passport systems.

    - [Map of cities](https://doughnuteconomics.org/themes/cities-regions) that have started work on implementing doughnut models
    - Understand what blockers they’ve faced so far in implementing the model, get in touch with select cities to understand local issues/narrow in on a specific sector. e.g. sustainable fishing (UBC Department), Eu construction material passports

### Enablers/Blockers

- **Privacy law + KYC/AML**: Product-level traceability involves consumer and supply-chain data, raising data-protection and compliance issues.
- **Identity & reputation**: Core to product-passport verification, linking digital records to real-world goods and brands.
- **Institutional inertia**: Large manufacturers and retailers move slowly on interoperability and shared standards, even with regulatory pressure.

### **Why it Matters for Ethereum**

Digital product passports illustrate Ethereum’s role as a shared substrate for real-world assets. They collapse verification and integration costs by giving every product a tamper-proof identity and lifecycle record — a foundation that can extend from luxury goods to critical-supply-chain materials, making physical commerce auditable, composable, and circular.

## The Opportunity

Small and medium enterprises face heavy overhead in managing core operations—cap tables, payroll, contracts, treasury, procurement, and accounting. Each function relies on siloed Web2 tools (Carta, QuickBooks, Gusto, Deel, Stripe, Stripe Atlas, Mercury, Brex, etc.) that don’t interoperate, require constant reconciliation, and are vulnerable to errors, fraud, or delay. Cross-border operations add friction in payments, compliance, and document workflows. As a result, early stage companies spend scarce time and money on back-office administration instead of growth.

At the same time, advances in AI create the potential for organizations that could be run and optimized by machine intelligence&mdash;but today’s firms are not software-defined systems. Their fragmented, bureaucratic infrastructure prevents AI from fully accessing or coordinating the organization as a computable whole.

## Ideas

- Cap Tables & Equity - Verifiable, onchain ownership records from day one (issuance, vesting, transfers)
- Roles & Permissions - Programmable, wallet-based authority systems enforcing who can move funds or sign agreements; onchain identifiers to represent employees/members
- Treasury Management - Stablecoin-based treasury with yield strategies, automated reporting, and compliance hooks
- Payroll & Invoicing - Instant, programmable global payouts with automated tax/KYC reporting
- Revenue & Profit Splits - Automated distributions to partners, employees, and investors tied to income events; tokenized revenue/profits; tokenize receivables/payables
- Commercial Agreements - Legal smart contracts embedding milestones, royalties, licensing, rebates, volume discounts, performance incentives, warranties, expiries, dispute handling directly into execution logic
- Bookkeeping & Accounting - Real-time, tamper-evident “triple-entry” ledgers providing auditable financial history
- Procurement - Smart contracts for purchase orders, RFQs, RFPs, vendor agreements, or automatic replenishment plans
- AI CEOs - Once the firm’s core systems are tokenized and software-defined, AI can act as an organizational brain&mdash;analyzing complete data flows, simulating strategies, and executing decisions onchain

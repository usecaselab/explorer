# Services & Tasks

### Problem

The global market for services and task-based labor—spanning freelancers, gig workers, consultants, coaches, and household help—depends heavily on centralized platforms that intermediate discovery, reputation, and payments. These intermediaries extract high fees and exert disproportionate control over visibility and client access. Workers are often locked into closed ecosystems that restrict portability of reputation or verified work history.

Trust between counterparties remains fragile: reviews are easily gamed, disputes lack transparency, and workers across borders face restricted access due to opaque platform policies rather than proven skill or reliability. This reduces both worker autonomy and market efficiency, particularly in domains where proof of quality or trustworthiness is hard to assess without a trusted intermediary.

### Opportunities

Ethereum can reduce verification and enforcement costs in peer-to-peer labor markets by enabling programmable settlement, verifiable work attestations, and decentralized reputation systems. Together, these mechanisms make it possible to coordinate trust and payments for services and tasks without a platform gatekeeper.

- **AI-agent co-labor paradigms:** Human and autonomous agent combinations (or agent-agent marketplaces) where agents execute standardized services and humans focus on high-value orchestration and oversight.
- **Agent-to-agent marketplaces:** AI agents that post and fulfill micro-tasks with verifiable results.
- **Specialized labor networks:** Domain-specific marketplaces (therapy, tutoring, consulting, pair programming, creative services) with tokenized access, verified expertise, and direct settlement.
- **Verifiable worker reputation:** Portable attestations for skills, completion history, and ratings stored onchain or via verifiable credentials, enabling cross-platform portability.
- **Programmable escrow:** Smart contracts for milestone-based payments, dispute resolution, and refunds that minimize platform mediation.
- **Task credentials:** Cryptographic proofs of work, verified deliverable receipts, or NFT-based certificates that unlock access to higher-value opportunities.
- **Decentralized arbitration systems:** Mediation solutions for labor contracting arrangements that ensure efficient and fair dispute outcomes.

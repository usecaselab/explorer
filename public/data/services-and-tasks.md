# Services & Tasks

## The Opportunity
Gig economy platforms extract high fees (up to 30%) and lock workers into their ecosystem. Reputation built on one app doesn't transfer to another. Workers lack ownership and benefits.

## Ideas

### Decentralized Talent Marketplaces
Platforms where fees are minimal, and governance is shared by the workers and clients.

### Portable Reputation
A standard for work history and ratings that a freelancer owns and can display on any platform.

### Service DAOs
Collectives of freelancers (designers, developers) who pool resources, share leads, and offer services as an agency.

### Time Banking
Tokenized exchange of hours, allowing communities to trade services (e.g., gardening for coding) without fiat currency.

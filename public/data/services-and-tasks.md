## The Opportunity

The global market for services and task-based labor&mdash;spanning freelancers, gig workers, consultants, coaches, and household help&mdash;depends heavily on centralized platforms that intermediate discovery, reputation, and payments. These intermediaries extract high fees and exert disproportionate control over visibility and client access. Workers are often locked into closed ecosystems that restrict portability of reputation or verified work history.

Trust between counterparties remains fragile: reviews are easily gamed, disputes lack transparency, and workers across borders face restricted access due to opaque platform policies rather than proven skill or reliability. This reduces both worker autonomy and market efficiency, particularly in domains where proof of quality or trustworthiness is hard to assess without a trusted intermediary.

## Ideas

- Worker reputation & credentials - Portable attestations for skills, work history, ratings, and task completions that workers own and carry across platforms
- Programmable escrow - Smart contracts for milestone-based payments, dispute resolution, and refunds that minimize platform mediation
- Arbitration - Mediation solutions for labor contracting arrangements that ensure efficient and fair dispute outcomes

## The Opportunity
Traditional corporate structures are rigid and opaque. DAOs (Decentralized Autonomous Organizations) offer a flexible, transparent way to coordinate global groups and capital.

## Ideas

### DAO Governance Tooling
Systems for proposal creation, voting, and automatic execution of results.

### Treasury Management
Multi-signature wallets and dashboards for managing shared organizational funds transparently.

### Payroll Streaming
Paying contributors by the second (real-time salary) instead of bi-weekly.

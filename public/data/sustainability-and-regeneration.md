## Problem

Many natural assets—such as water, forests and mineral resources—are extracted or consumed without adequate accounting for long-term sustainability or ecosystem value. Existing carbon markets and decarbonization schemes often lack trusted measurement and enforcement, undermining climate action and corporate claims. Conservation projects struggle to attract sufficient capital because biodiversity and ecosystem services are difficult to quantify and monetize. Meanwhile, circular-economy practices like reuse and recycling remain marginal because there is no reliable way to measure impact, trace product life cycles or reward participation.

## Opportunities

Ethereum can make the value of ecosystems, resources and circular economies easier to transparently track, finance and sustainably manage.

- **Tokenising ecological assets:** Creating tradable digital representations of forests, water rights, biodiversity credits or recycled material flows.
- **Credible measurement & verification:** Using oracles, remote-sensing and blockchain logs to provide evidence-trails for environmental outcomes (e.g., carbon sequestration, restoration) with provenance.
- **Traceable supply & material flows for circularity:** Tracking recycling, reuse, product-life-cycles and certification of materials in a transparent ledger.
- **Quality-tiered environmental assets:** Differentiating asset classes by methodology, provenance, verification quality and governance, enabling transparency across markets.
- **Outcome-linked finance with milestones:** Smart-contract-based release of funds or credits when independently verifiable events (e.g., reforestation, water-quality improvement) occur.

## Emerging Trends

- Growing corporate demand for **verifiable ESG reporting** and high-integrity environmental claims, creating pressure for credible measurement infrastructure.
- Advances in remote-sensing, IoT and AI enable **continuous monitoring** of land use, forestry and agriculture, making real-time environmental verification more feasible.

## Leverage Points

- [Climate Action Data](https://climateactiondata.org/about/) - connects carbon-credit registries (both national and independent standards) via a common data model and open-source software so data can be shared across these individual systems. Uses blockchain or decentralised ledger technology to record metadata to improve transparency, reduce double-counting risk, and help trust in carbon markets.

---

## Enablers / Blockers

- **Measurement & verification:** Reliable, standardised monitoring (satellite, IoT) plus secure oracles are essential but still immature. Without robust real-world data linking to on-chain records, environmental credit markets or asset tokenisation risk credibility and adoption failures.
- **Regulatory clarity & standardisation:** Tokenising nature-based assets or credits raises issues of asset classification, double-counting, jurisdictional compliance and governance. Ambiguity around carbon-credit standards, biodiversity credits, tradeable material-credits or nature tokens creates regulatory risk and slows institutional adoption.

## Why It Matters for Ethereum

By anchoring environmental-asset passports, provenance records, milestone-linked payments and tokenized credit issuance, Ethereum enables systems where ecological value can be tracked, traded and governed transparently. As demand grows for credible ESG claims, carbon removal, circular economy metrics and nature-based investment, Ethereum becomes the trust and coordination layer allowing disparate actors to align, transact and verify outcomes at scale. The infrastructure built here can unlock new capital flows into restoration, recycling and sustainable practices that otherwise remain underfunded or opaque.

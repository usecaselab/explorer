# Alternative Money

## The Opportunity
Money design has long been limited to state and bank-backed systems. Alternative models rarely scale. Communities want value-aligned currencies but lack the platforms and governance to issue and sustain them. New currencies face barriers in liquidity, trust, regulatory hurdles, and go-to-market.

## Ideas

### Algorithmic money supply

Design currencies that automatically adjust their supply based on real-time demand to maintain purchasing power stability without central bank intervention.

### Labor-backed money

Create issuance mechanisms where tokens are minted solely through verifiable proof of human work or community service.

### Energy-backed money

Tokens pegged to or minted by kilowatt-hours of renewable energy production, creating a currency backed by physical laws.

### UBI issuance

Networks that distribute newly minted tokens equally to verified unique humans, creating a baseline of economic security.

### Credit-based issuance

Mutual credit clearing systems where money is created through the extension of trust between peers rather than central debt.

### Index/basket pegged

Stablecoins pegged to a diversified basket of consumer goods (CPI on-chain) rather than volatile fiat currencies.

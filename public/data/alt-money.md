## The Opportunity

Money underpins every exchange, yet the design space for monetary systems has been narrowly dominated by state fiat and bank-reserve backed money. Alternative forms&mdash;including local currencies, mutual credit systems, demurrage money or algorithmic units of account&mdash;have historically struggled to scale. Many communities, municipalities and networks desire currencies that reflect their values and incentives, but lack reliable platforms, protocols and governance frameworks to design, issue, and circulate them. Innovators face the challenge of creating currencies that function as a viable **store of value**, **medium of exchange** and/or **unit of account**, while addressing liquidity, trust and adoption constraints.

## Ideas

- Algorithmic monetary policy - Currencies whose supply and issuance rules are enforced directly by smart contracts (e.g., automatic demurrage fees, inflation-indexed issuance, or onchain revenue redistribution) instead of central banks or human discretion
- Community currencies - Place- or network-specific currencies used by defined communities (cities, cooperatives, regions) to keep spending local, incentivize participation, and fund shared goods rather than leaking value to external markets
- Mutual credit - Systems where money is created as reciprocal credit between participants, with balances emerging from trust, reputation, and settlement rules instead of pre-minted tokens or bank deposits
- Labor-backed money - Exchange systems where units represent time, skills, or completed work, allowing participants to trade services directly without relying on fiat pricing or external currencies
- Commodity-backed units - Monetary units redeemable for, or explicitly linked to, measurable physical resources (such as kWh of electricity, carbon units, or physical commodities), grounding value in real production capacity
- Indexed currencies - Currencies designed to maintain stable purchasing power by algorithmically tracking inflation metrics, commodity prices, or diversified economic indicators rather than pegging to a single fiat currency

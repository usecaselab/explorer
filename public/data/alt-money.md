# Alternative Money

## Problem

Money underpins every exchange, yet the design space for monetary systems has been narrowly dominated by state fiat and bank-reserve backed money. Alternative forms — including local currencies, mutual credit systems, demurrage money or algorithmic units of account — have historically struggled to scale. Many communities, municipalities and networks desire currencies that reflect their values and incentives, but lack reliable platforms, protocols and governance frameworks to design, issue and circulate them. Innovators face the challenge of creating currencies that function as a viable **store of value**, **medium of exchange** and/or **unit of account**, while addressing liquidity, trust and adoption constraints.

## Opportunities

Ethereum can enable networks, communities and regions to design, issue and govern currencies aligned with their values, supported by interoperable infrastructure for issuance, circulation, and user authentication.

- **Algorithmic monetary policy:** Supply rules embedded in code, exploring demurrage (negative interest), inflation-adjusted supply, or seigniorage-share models.
- **Community & local currencies:** Network- or territory-based currencies (e.g., BerkShares, Grassroots Economics, CityCoins, Circles) that enable value capture and tailored incentives for local economies.
- **Credit-based money:** Mutual credit networks or IOU systems where medium of exchange emerges from platform trust and reputation rather than bank money.
- **Commodity- or energy-backed units:** Currencies tied to baskets of goods, energy production or reserves (e.g., energy-linked credits or asset-backed stable tokens).
- **Labor- and service-backed money:** Time-banking, service-exchange systems where value is anchored in labor or trusted work rather than fiat.
- **Indexed or basket currencies:** Units constructed to preserve purchasing power by tracking commodities or economic indicators.
- **Barter networks & swap-based systems:** Peer networks where value circulates via alternative mediums of exchange enabled by protocol tools and tokenization.

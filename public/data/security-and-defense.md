## Problem

National defence and critical infrastructure increasingly depend on digital systems which are vulnerable to attack and manipulation. Supply-chains can be compromised with counterfeit or tampered components, cyber-defence still depends on secrets which may leak, and battlefield decision-makers face a deluge of unverified sensor data. As AI becomes embedded in operations, the integrity and provenance of both data and models become existential concerns. Traditional systems lack tamper-resistant audit-trails, real-time verification of sensor inputs or secure tracking of software and hardware artifacts. As autonomous systems proliferate, the risk of embedded adversarial manipulation of components or models grows, making provenance and real-time trust layers essential.

## Opportunities

Protocols anchored on Ethereum can reduce verification, enforcement and integration costs in defence-cyber systems by providing transparent chains of custody auditability, portable trust credentials and composable verification infrastructure.

- **Authenticated users & validated sensor inputs:** Smart-contract-anchored identity for users plus audit-trails for battlefield IoT and AI systems.
- **Security-clearance credentials:** Portable, verifiable credentials for personnel which persist beyond traditional paper or siloed digital systems.
- **Cyber-threat-intelligence marketplaces:** Tokenised and audited platforms for sharing threat data securely and verifiably across agencies and trusted partners.
- **On-chain versioning registry for software artifacts:** SBOM-level provenance for software components and dependencies to prevent supply-chain attacks.
- **Supply-chain provenance for defense hardware:** Immutable tracking of parts, maintenance histories and provenance for weapons-systems and components.
- **Decentralised decision-aid networks:** Secure sharing and verification of AI-model updates, sensor-data cross-validation in multi-domain operations.

## Emerging Trends

Now is an opportune moment for this use case because digital warfare and cyber-risk are escalating while provenance and trust-deficits grow:

- The rise of AI-enabled defence systems, autonomous drones-swarms and multi-domain battle networks.
- The proliferation of IoBT (Internet of Battlefield Things) connecting sensors, vehicles and troops in real-time.
- The surge in supply-chain attacks and software-dependency risks (for example via SBOM vulnerabilities).

## Enablers / Blockers

- **Interoperability & legacy-system integration”:** Defence and critical-infrastructure systems include many legacy platforms, classified networks and proprietary protocols, which complicates integration of new ledger-based layers. Without smooth integration into legacy systems and trusted networks, blockchain-based trust layers won't gain traction. Relatedly, defence use-cases require defining who controls the ledger, how access is managed, classification of data, and how cross-agency/proprietary coordination occurs. This unclear governance models and trust boundaries reduce willingness of agencies to deploy shared protocols.
- **Data-quality & provenance assurance (Cybersecurity wide issue):** If the source data (sensor data, SBOM content, chain-of-custody records) is tampered, incomplete or unverifiable, then the blockchain layer cannot guarantee actual integrity. The “garbage in = garbage out” principle applies; provenance only matters if input systems are trustworthy.

## Why It Matters for Ethereum

By anchoring credentials, supply-chain provenance, audit-trails and sensor-data validation on-chain, Ethereum enables trust-minimised coordination across agencies, suppliers and operational domains. As adversarial threats and autonomous systems proliferate, the ability to deploy composable, transparent infrastructure for defence greatly amplifies Ethereum’s role beyond fintech and into foundational digital-sovereignty infrastructure.

*New insight:* Defense-grade applications can help establish high-assurance protocol governance, privacy-preserving credentialing and composable orchestration that then benefit broader infrastructure domains.

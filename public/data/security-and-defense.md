# Security & Defense

## The Opportunity
National security relies on secure supply chains and trusted communication. Cyberattacks and information warfare are growing threats. verifying the integrity of hardware, software, and data is critical.

## Ideas

### Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) on-chain
Immutable logs of all components in critical software to track vulnerabilities and prevent supply chain attacks.

### Resilient Mesh Networks
Decentralized communication networks that can survive infrastructure failures or jamming.

### Data Integrity Verification
Using cryptographic hashing to ensure that surveillance footage, intelligence reports, or commands have not been tampered with.

### Zero-Trust Access Control
Managing access to sensitive facilities or systems using decentralized identity and capability tokens.

## The Opportunity

Cultural production and distribution is bottlenecked by centralized intermediaries (studios, labels, ticketing giants, streaming platforms) that capture outsized value while creators and fans face high costs, limited transparency, and restricted access. Piracy, fake tickets, opaque royalties, and inequitable revenue splits undermine trust and sustainability. 

## Ideas

- NFT-based ticketing - Verifiable, resalable access to events, concerts, and festivals
- Crowdfunded media - Onchain funding and governance for films, music, and journalism
- Royalty tracking and payouts - Smart contracts for transparent rights management
- Tokenized fan engagement - Invest in artists, songs, or franchises with fractional ownership
- Decentralized streaming and publishing - Censorship-resistant platforms for content distribution
- Verifiable journalism - Provenance for media assets and claims, linked to fact-checking oracles

## The Opportunity
Creators rely on platforms (Spotify, YouTube) that dictate monetization and reach. Web3 enables direct creator-to-fan relationships and new royalty models.

## Ideas

### Music NFTs
Selling songs or albums as limited editions where fans can share in royalties or access exclusive perks.

### Web3 Publishing
Blogging platforms where posts are stored on-chain and readers can tip or subscribe directly to the writer's wallet.

### Decentralized Streaming
Video or audio streaming protocols that pay creators by the second via micropayments.

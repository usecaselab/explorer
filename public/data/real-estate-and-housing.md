## The Opportunity

Real estate transactions require many intermediaries, including brokers, title companies, banks, registries, insurers, and notaries. Records reside across disconnected databases and paper-based workflows, which slow settlement, raise costs, and increase administrative burden. Ownership histories are often incomplete, title disputes are common, and verifying property maintenance or energy performance data is difficult. Smaller owners and renters face obstacles in accessing credit, verifying identity, and establishing reliable references.

## Ideas

- Onchain title & escrow - Smart contracts replace paper registries and manual escrow flows, reducing settlement time and improving transparency
- Smart-contract leasing - Lease payments, deposits, renewals and dispute resolution run via code, eliminating many intermediaries
- Tokenized real-estate funds - Fractional access and transparent investor reporting allow smaller investors to participate in property markets
- Onchain mortgage & home-equity rails - Servicing and secondary markets become programmable, traceable and accessible
- Community ownership primitives - Co-ops and land trusts based on token-governance enable inclusive ownership and local alignment

# Real Estate & Housing

## The Opportunity
Real estate is illiquid and has high barriers to entry. Tokenization allows for fractional ownership, while blockchain registries reduce title fraud.

## Ideas

### Fractional Ownership
Tokenizing a high-value property into 1000 pieces, allowing anyone to invest with $100.

### On-Chain Title Registry
Moving land deeds to a blockchain to prevent forgery and speed up closing times.

### Rental Smart Contracts
Automated lease agreements that hold security deposits and accept rent payments in stablecoins.
